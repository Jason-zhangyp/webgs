# Example Script:

repeat 3


const x *2
const y *1

start startAc(bob, 1, 37.086699, -76.378911)
time wait(20)

# param file(bob, Examples/Parameters/icarous_custom1.txt)
adjust param file(bob, Examples/Parameters/icarous_custom1.txt, x, bob, Examples/Parameters/icarous_custom2.txt, y)

# time wait(10)

forward start(bob, 127.0.0.1, 14570, 57600)

adjust wp wpLoad(bob, Examples/FlightPlans/test_flightplan1.txt, y, bob, Examples/FlightPlans/test_flightplan2.txt, y, bob, Examples/FlightPlans/test_flightplan1.txt, y)

# geofence load(bob1, 1, Examples/GeoFences/test_geofence1.xml)

traffic add(bob, 1000, 37.10175, -76.38752, 0, 45, 10, 3, 45, 10, 255)
traffic file(bob, 1001, Examples/Traffic/test_traffic1.txt)

# Time must be added to allow the flight to run before the shutdown commands are given
time wait(40)

time wait(10)

stop bob

# This runs three times, starts one aircraft, then adds a single intruder, starts the flight, lets them interact for
#    a certian time period, removes the intruder, waits, then shuts down the aircraft.

# NOTES:
# All commands follow the format:
#       type function(arguments)

# All commands have a predefined timeout period before the next command is sent
#       This changes depending on the time needed to execute the command, ex. start is much longer than wait.
#       These execution timeout's can be adjusted in flybyfile.js lines 168-177.

# timing and start locations will need to be carefully selected to ensure test is running as expected. I would
#       recomend running the script a single time before adding repeats to ensure expected behavior. I will be
#       looking into adding recording of events to make script building easier.

# Traffic will auto start when added
# Traffic id should start at 1000 and increment up

# Stop all is added between repeats (shuts down all running aircraft instances)

# If you haven't figured it out yet all lines with a # are comments, the interpreter will ignore it and any blank lines.
# For now use spaces not tabs.

# Repeat must be the first line in the script if it is going to be used.

# Adjust - the number of times args must add up to the number of repeats.

# const - add a constant to reduce repetitive typing when editing a script, especially when editing adjust and repeat, format const (name) (assigned value)
#       You have to use the whole word not just part (ex. if replacing *2 you cant just put x = 2, and try to use *x  it has to be x = *2, x)

# Use a name for the aircraft id, not a number. A number might cause problems with the groundstation internal tracking of aircraft.
#    I'm not really sure about this, but just in case I would recomend it. The name can contain numbers like s1000, just not a single
#    number like 1.

# EXAMPLE COMMANDS
# start startAc(id, 1/0, lat, lng)
# adjust type function([args], *num of times, [args], *num of times)
# param file(path/to/file1.txt)
# param single(id, param_id,param_value param_type)
# wp wpLoad(id, path/to/file.txt)
# geofence load(id, fence_id, path/to/file.xml)
# time wait(s)
# long MISSION_START(id)
# traffic add(id, t_id, lat, lng, range, bearing, alt, gs, hdg, vs)
# traffic remove(id, t_id)
# traffic file(id, t_id, path/to/file.txt)
# wind function(args)   built in function can be as simple as magnatude and direction or something much more complicated
# stop id



# TODO
# Need to build an interupt to stop the script early
# Continue testing everything
